				<h2>About</h2>
				
				<p>The Goa Heritage Project started off as a year long project funded by the British Council and the Prince Claus Fund to document and disseminate Goan heritage and culture through emergent art and technology platforms such as immersive media, video games and smartphone experiences.</p>
				
				<p>Our intention is to create and share a sustainable repository of digital heritage prototypes that are ripe for further development and incubation in partnership with the people and institutions of Goa.</p>
				
				<p>Bringing the voices of people into the design of future heritage experiences is key to the sustainability of culture, and our project explores various routes to participation in the design process. The artistic outcomes of this project live a parallel life as potential frameworks for collaboration that can bring greater vibrance and sustainability of cultural heritage to the state of Goa.</p>
				
				<p>Further funding from the India Foundation of the Arts and Tata Trusts has helped us work with the Goa Chitra Museum in Goa.</p>
